# Lyric Match by Dripto

This is a fun game which challenges you to guess the name of a song based on lyrics. Try it out here:

Follow the following steps to run this on your system locally:

## Step 1: Setup the Backend

First you need to setup the backend. Check out [this repo](https://github.com/driptobhattacharyya/Lyric-Match-Backend).


## Step 2: Initial setup

1. Clone the repo onto your local machine
    ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/driptobhattacharyya/Lyric-Match-Frontend.git
   ```
2. Install node modules
    ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Step 3: Connect with your Backend

1. Find "api.ts" (under src -> services)
2. Change the "API_URL" to the URL on which your backend is accessible (perhaps "localhost:5000")

## Step 4: Run the app

Run the app using the following command on your terminal:
 ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```
